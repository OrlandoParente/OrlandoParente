## Hi I'm Orlando Parente 
In high school, I discovered programming and Linux. Since then, *Linux has become my main operating system*. I have tried many Linux distributions, and my favorite distribution family is *Debian-based*. My first approach to programming was with the C language: the majority of the computer science program in high school was about programming in C. After high school, I decided to go to university to become a better programmer. During this period, I was introduced to *Java*, which *has become my main programming language*.  

Today, **I'm primarily a backend Java Spring Boot developer**. I like the Java style in general, and I'm ready to explore other parts of the Java world beyond Spring Boot. My focus is on the backend, but **I can handle the front-end** if needed (JavaScript, Thymeleaf, CSS, HTML, a little bit of Angular).  

Check out my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OrlandoParente-xu1lb) for a video explation of my GitHub projects.
